Wether it's an email for your soccer team, band or office, rarely is replying to everyone truly necessary. Let's forego the debate on when it's appropriate, and just agree we've all received more Reply All emails than we would like.

## Copy That

![BCC Everyone](/assets/media/bcc.png)

It's that simple, really. Address your email as usual, and <abbr title="Blind Carbon Copy">Bcc</abbr> everyone else. *Announcing a promotion?* **Address the actual employee**. *Emailing everyone as a whole?* **Address yourself.** *Need to include someone who may also benefit from a reply?* **<abbr title="Carbon Copy">Cc</abbr> them.**

## Transparency

Then there's the trust factor. Did I, the original sender, email everyone? Or, just specific people? Is this an "In" thing? Is it OK to bring the message up with other coworkers? This is a non-issue, really, when used appropriately. However, if there's any doubt, it might be better to specifically call attention to the fact that the communication is in fact for EVERYONE. Your call on how to handle that, whether in the Subject or the Body.

***

I'm sure I'm not the only person to do this. But then again, I've received about 50 Reply All emails this week. *Happy sending.*
