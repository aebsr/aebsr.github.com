This just in, blogging is hard. What's even harder, is not being more involved in the community and industry I've dedicated so much of the last decade to. At last here we are, on the 5th incarnation of "me online."

And that, is an obligatory rap reference. You can expect at least one of those, in context, per post.

In general I'm a reluctant <strike>denizen</strike> citizen of the tech community. A self proclaimed [#dctech](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23dctech) expat. Despite my traditionally "anti" nature I'm trying to change that. As I stumble through git commits and missing meetups, I'll try and find a balance between life, community and code.

Until then.
