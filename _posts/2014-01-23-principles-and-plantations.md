description: "Tech conferences tend to be a bit culturaly void, but was a cultural gut check in order for CSSConf?"
---

I couldn't make this quick, so I hope it's not like slowly pulling off a cultural band-aid. One of the reasons I've resparked my involvement in the design and development community is to promote diversity. That's something most in our field never _have_ to concern themselves with -- at least not in the professional space. So here I am, doing what I've said I'd do for the past 3 years. Putting myself out there. Submitting talks and engaging with those whose steady presence in our community often defines it.

 This is not a protest. I'm just thinking out loud, hopefully not spitting in the wind.

## TL;DR Version

Tech conferences tend to reflect our community's gender and cultural void. [CSSConf](http://2014.cssconf.com/) is a super cool-looking conference in a beach town hosted at [Amelia Island Plantation Resort](http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1996-04-21/news/9604181064_1_amelia-island-small-farms-american-beac). Plantations have obviously ugly histories, and this one in particular is especially ugly. In my opinion, someone involved should have pushed to host it elsewhere. That said, I'm still submitting a talk. Why? Because diversity, dammit.

## Gut Checks

Having worked in advertising in some shape or form for 5 years, I've either requested -- or been requested to provide -- a gut check. That moment where a well-meaning marketer asks, "Is this racist?" or when the local meet-up questions whether to tout "women" as a perk of attendance.

I suspect there were plenty of these kind of gut checks before "Women in Tech" became a *thing*. When it was just Sarah in a room full of young white men, fustrated with sexist comments and indifference to her presence, I imagine her asking herself, "Is it just me?"

Before writing this, I requested a gut check. You see, I have a talk I've put together for some conferenecs, specifically confs that I had been eyeing for some time. By chance, I noticed something about [CSSConf](http://2014.cssconf.com/). Besides the lego drop, which I literally just noticed yesterday. Its location, the **Omni Amelia Island Plantation Resort**, immediately rubbed me the wrong way.

## Déjà vu

In case you missed, Ani DiFranco's retreat, after receiving so much online protest around its location, was cancelled.  It, however, was at an actual [plantation](http://www.nola.com/music/index.ssf/2013/12/ani_difrancos_plantation_retre.html). CSSConf, on the other hand, is at a hotel, one that's either close to plantations and/or has a passive adoration for the history of the area.

This topic is fresh and has fueled lots of discussion, but ultimately the protesters' goal was always to have Ani DiFranco's retreat cancelled or moved. **I do not, under any circumstances, want that to be the case here. This is not a call for action, but rather a call for discussion.**

## But It's Just A Name, Right?

You know, I thought so, too. I spent an hour or so trying to convince myself it wasn't worth talking about. I mean, not all plantations had slaves right? But I did some research, and it turns out that for Amelia Island, it is indeed far more than just a name. Far more than a vague, long-past history, the hotel's more recent history is marked by -- for lack of better words -- a [shitty string of events](http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1996-04-21/news/9604181064_1_amelia-island-small-farms-american-beac) that pretty much embody everything wrong with modern destinations clinging to their plantation roots.

I don't recall who originally said this, but my feelings can be summed up in the same vein: "I dislike all big, old white houses, because ultimately you know they were built on the backs of slaves." Today, they operate as passive homages to a simpler time and destinations for the elite to celebrate their successes.

## With Love

I don't know the people behind CSSConf personally. I have seen Nicole speak twice, and despite my aversion to her use of `.h1` as a class name, she remains one of the top 3 developers I'd love to work with. I don't doubt Nicole, Lea, Chris or Laura want only the best for their conference and our community. I only wish there had been a voice to speak up and ask, "Is this venue ok?" But for all I know, there was. Maybe the location was discussed and picked anyway. All I know for sure is that I personally would have preferred a conference for a community with such homogeneous tendencies be hosted elsewhere.

## High Roads and Hypocrisies

> Don't believe the hype, it's a sequel / As an equal can I get this through to you *[Don't Believe The Hype](http://rapgenius.com/Public-enemy-dont-believe-the-hype-lyrics)*

So after all my gut checks and airing out my grievances here, I still _plan_ to submit my talk to CSSConf. For one reason above all else: If my talk is considered worthy of sharing the stage with the other speakers, my presence can help promote the diversity I think may have missing when the venue was selected. Ultimately, one other developer of color might see me on stage and think, "Hm, maybe I should submit a talk." Or, some kid stops thinking what we do is reserved for suburban white kids. Then, being called a hypocrite for a few months will be worth it. It doesn't have to be me, but I would like it to be someone -- sooner, rather than later.

I understand this post puts those who pick the sessions in an awkward position. They could appear as either omitting my talk out of spite or including me out of an attempt at affirmative action (EEWWW). However, based on what little I know of these people, neither scenario will be the case. My talk proposal will most likely succeed or fail based on the merit of the subject and my experience alone.

## There They Go Again

Just before publishing this, it occurred to me that it all may read as a militant, ungrateful, and oversensative statement that implies those involved are racists. If that's how this post is perceived, I'm sorry. What remains the same are my beliefs that more diversity in tech is needed, and we should question issues that many may never think to consider.
