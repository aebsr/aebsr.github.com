I'm Antoine, a UI Engineer at [TravelBank](https://travelbank.com/). I once spoke at a [conference](http://2014.cssconf.com/) and was even published [once](http://www.creativebloq.com/netmag/issue-258-81412615) or [twice](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/smashing-newsletter-issue-118/#a6). Though this is probably my favorite [shot out](http://www.slideshare.net/cameronmoll/good-vs-great-design).

I've got 15 years [experience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aebsr/). Having honed my skills [here](http://nclud.com), [here](http://eightshapes.com) and [here](http://hzdg.com).

I'm a dad, husband and crossfitter who enjoys motorcycles, guns, philosophy and music.
