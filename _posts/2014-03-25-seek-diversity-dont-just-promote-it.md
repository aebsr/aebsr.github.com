As a hip hop enthusiast turned web developer I'm all too familiar with the history and issues my passions share. A friends' recent marginalization in the workplace exemplifies why diversity in so important.

Which sparked my desire to expand on this sentiment:

> We all should be aware of how we unknowingly perpetuate stigmas and stereotypes, from within our own homogenous circles.

Before I hit those keys and get on my soap box, I'll share a video of [Jay Smooth](http://twitter.com/jsmooth995) at [XOXO Festival](http://2014.xoxofest.com/) in 2013. Where he explains why we need to seek diversity, not just promote it.
