It was bound to happen every now and then, though I didn't expect it to be so soon. This past Friday, I didn't [write something](/2016/01/01/write-something/). For shame.

I spent the day with my TravelBank team whom are based in San Francisco. We met with users and previewed application updates. There was so much to catch up on and absorb there was no time for me to think about writing anything other than lines of code. As the day came to a close I found myself in [Georgetown](http://washington.org/DC-guide-to/georgetown) with a couple hours to kill. My phone was down to 30% and I didn't have my laptop. So marched down M Street in search of, anything to help the time go by. Keeping an eye on my calorie burn via my Apple Watch. Ive got to take every opportunity to burn that fat.

I spotted a Godiva store, my wife's favorite. Which was lucky considering the one near us had recently closed. After a brief stop there to load up on truffles I walked into Clyde's of Georgetown. It was bustling, as one would expect on a Friday night.

I took the lone seat at the edge of the bar next to the Waiter & Waitress Station and ordered a Blanton's.

Oh, and I also ordered a Caesar Salad. Because, calories dammit. That's when I began to really take in the moment.

## Alone In A Crowd

It was refreshing. Sitting amongst a sea of unfamiliar faces. Shooting the shit with the Wait Staff. Debating the merits of me drinking Bourbon on a diet. Talking about what makes a successful marriage. Guessing each other's ages. I'd people watch, overhearing two transplants dismiss other's authenticity as "From DC" because they didn't arrive pre-gentrification.

For a while I wasn't defined by what people already knew about me. It wasn't about my job, politics or family. It was freeing. Something I guess people who travel a lot feel very often. Able to sit back and take in new experiences and interactions in such a pure way.

I've got to say, besides the bill I kind of like drinking alone.
