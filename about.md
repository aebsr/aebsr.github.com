I'm the Lead UI Engineer at TravelBank where I help build the interface for a hybrid responsive web application. I've spoken at [CSSConf](http://2014.cssconf.com/) and have written a few pieces on the subject of that talk in Smashing Newsletter and Net Magazine.

I discovered the web through my first passion, music. Cutting my teeth on websites for my group and others in the local Hip Hop community. In 2001 I turned what had been a hobby into a career. One that was largely built on being a contractor resource for startups and agencies such as [AKQA](http://akqa.com), [nclud](http://nclud.com), [EightShapes](http://eightshapes.com) and [HZDG](http://hzdg.com).

Some well-known brands I've worked with include [Washington Redskins](http://www.hzdg.com/work/redskins/), [Volkswagen](http://www.hzdg.com/work/volkswagen) [King Arthur Flour](http://www.hzdg.com/work/king-arthur), [Hilton](http://hzdg.tumblr.com/post/63650525553/hilton-hotels-resorts-hilton-hotels-resorts) and [USPS](http://usps.com).

I maintain three open source projects in the form of my children. Beyond that, I'm an anti nerd, much more interested in who people are than what they do. So I don't talk tech too often unless I'm offering some bit of unsolicited criticism. I have a lot of hobbies. On the rare occasion I'm not either working or spending time with my family you can find me on a motorcycle, at the shooting range, or in a recording studio.
