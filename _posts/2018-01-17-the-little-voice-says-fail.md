I’ve been a called a pessimist but I prefer to think of myself as an emotional "prepper.”  It's not the worst that could happen that consumes me, it's a need to desensitize myself to those realities. If I were truly stoic, I’d say my preoccupation is actually about acceptance of the many things I can’t control.

The other day I found myself marathoning a series of posts from a dear friend, about a sensitive subject. I’ve been the digital voyeur to someone’s very personal struggle before. This time it helped provide a little perspective.

In an era where we curate a digital image of how we want the world to see us, it’s easy to forget the value in vulnerability. Online, I dole out kudos to those on similar journeys. I document my successes in physical and mental fitness. What’s often missing is the failures, the misses, and the fears. The struggle no one sees or hears about because you only admit it to the little voice in your head.

## Ready to Die

Dramatic, I know. But B.I.G’s debut album title encapsulates my mentality. In fact, I’ll use it’s track list as an outline for what these voices in my head have been whispering.

> It’s hard being young from the slums.
<br> – Things Done Changed

Look back on your life. The decisions you’ve made and how you ended up where ever you are. For better or worst, you aren’t the same person you were 30, 20 or even 10 years ago. As the world around you changes, so do you. As you change, so does the world immediately around you. Or, so it should.
These changes in perspective and outlook, shape what you do tomorrow. They are the reason I'm writing this, today.

> I’m a bad, bad man.
<br> – Gimme the Loot

The concept of loot is variable, though for me it was once very literal. Chasing money gets old though, and as I’ve found, becomes very unsatisfying. I’d rather find happiness with what I have. As I solidify my stance on “money” in those terms, I’d say loot now is a measure of physical ability. Give me the loot, the gainz, the progress. I want to run faster, jump higher, lift heavier than I did last week. I care less about what I see in the mirror than I what I see myself do. I want to move. I want to be capable of living a challenging life while maintaining a simple one. So every day in the gym, or dancing with my daughter, I'm hustling. I'm grinding towards something.

> I don’t wanna live no more, sometimes I hear knocking at my front door. I’m living everyday like a hustle, another drug to juggle
<br> – Everyday Struggle

I don’t follow the news and don’t need to. The world is full of horrible, disgusting, selfish people and random unfortunate events. So I choose to focus on what I can control or at the very least “affect.” Measuring the value of one’s best self by how they better those around them. A simple metric for communal betterment. Without it, why bother.

> When I die, fuck it I want to go to hell cause I’m a piece of shit. It ain’t hard to fucking tell.
<br> – Suicidal Thoughts

In 3 weeks I’m competing in a local CrossFit tournament. If you asked me if I were excited, I’d say no. I’d tell you, how I don’t want to embarrass myself. I’d say my goal is to “not cry, or hurt myself.” Because despite all the hard work and success, there’s a nagging sense unworthiness. The fitness version of imposter syndrome. There’s this voice in the back of my head telling me I haven’t come as far as I have. That I don’t deserve to be here. So this competition is equal parts a celebration of my progress and a reckoning for my ego.

> Guaranteed satisfaction…
<br> – Just Playing

There’s not much I can quote from that song without pissing someone off. That said, all the self reflection and paranoia aside - a brother is feeling himself. So whether my shoulder goes to complete shit; I tear a new hole in my stomach; My costochondritis flares up; I rip my hands open; or some other catastrophic failure of my mind, body or soul; I’m still approaching this challenge with excitement and momentum.

Because I haven’t made it this far to win shit. I’ve made it this far to be healthy and capable enough to have fun trying.

And should I fail, fuck it. I’m ready to die.
