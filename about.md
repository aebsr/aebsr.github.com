An ’80s baby and male, hailing from the DMV. That’s D.C. by birth, Maryland by choice and Virginia by hell or high water.

## Short-form Bio

Antoine Butler has 12 years experience in marketing, web design and development. He serves as a Senior Front End Developer at [HZ](http://hzdg.com). There are few things beyond family, music and the web that Antoine is passionate about.

## The Resume

Worked for startups including [Personal](http://personal.com), [TravelShark](http://travelshark.com) and [PaySimple](http://paysimple.com).

## Outside of Work

My wife and kids keep me very busy. Between soccer, karate, gymnastics and diapers, I try to fit in at least one date night every other week.

#### Idle Hands

On the rare ocassion I'm not otherwise committed, I'll spend my time making music (my first passion), exercising or at the range -- think gun powder, not golf balls.
