excerpt: "More of the same. Ego. Vanity. Social media. But, that might be ok."

I hope that title reads as pretentious as it felt to write. Back from an epic work trip to Las Vegas a coworker asked why I don't write here anymore. The last time being 21 months ago.

I mumbled through the many reasons but the ultimate real answer was, to check my ego. Even my best efforts can't thwart a little indulgence in digital vanity. Some of it is unapologetic. Personal records in the gym, delicious meal preparations, and highlights from my kids. But outside of that, anything else I thought to share seemed gratuitous. So, I stopped.

That's when the coworker shared their perspective on what I wrote. A sentiment echoed by friends and family when I explain why I stopped making music, or writing in general. I'm not extrinsic enough to put into words the real take away here, but I'll try.

A side effect of studying Stoicism is that I can be very critical on the why's behind things. Why I write. Why I post. Why I share. Deep down, no matter the other reasons at play, ego rears its head. That moment alone, has caused me to leave creative spaces and outlets that once brought me joy. To a select few, that voice was missed.

I can't promise what I'll do next, or that it'll be of any value. But if you like what I've ever had to say - I'm going to try saying it again. 

Hopefully, humbly.
