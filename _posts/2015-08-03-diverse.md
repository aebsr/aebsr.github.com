It's odd, how quiet I've been since my [last post](/2014/12/11code-the-block). Given everything that's been going on in tech, at work, and in the world at large. I've had much to say, but little time to bring closure to the thoughts I'd jot down. And so, for the past 8 months, I've been silent. What's consumed much of my attention this year has been the boring chain of how, when, and why of building a diverse work force.

## I've Never Been A Company's diversity

It dawned on me during a twitter exchange with [Garran](https://twitter.com/garannm) that I somehow, have always found myself in diverse teams. Wether it be working for the Government, Creative Agencies or in the Private Sector.

And so, as Peter once [warned](http://istrategylabs.com/2014/05/diversity-at-istrategylabs-by-the-numbers/#comment-35049), at risk of pissing someone off here's my experience with diversity in tech. By the numbers. And full disclosure, for brevity and to emphasize the team makeup I'll be referring to everyone by their most obvious traits.

### Private Sector

Self taught and after making websites on my own for 3 years, I took the lead development role at a Think Tank in Virginia. Replacing a Black Howard University Graduate in the position. I reported to a White woman and oversaw two junior designer/developer hybrids. One male, mixed race of Asian decent. The other, a female also mixed race of Jordanian decent.

By tech standards our team was 100% minority.

### Government

Chasing more responsibility I ended up running a 5 member dev team. Replacing a White woman in the role who chose to work closer to home after having a baby, while remaining a remote member of the team. When I started, that team was made up of 1 White woman, 1 gay White man, 1 gay Black man, 1 Black woman and 1 Asian woman. When my time there ended due to attrition and new  hires the team make up lost a Black woman and gained 1 White woman, 1 Black man and 1 White man.

Including me, that makes for an 8 person team. 7 of of which would be considered minorities or members of marginalized groups.

### Agencies

Here it gets harder to gauge. I've freelanced and contracted at a ton of places. But I'll focus my attention on my longest and most diverse experience. Which happens to have been at a large global Agency. I joined a team too big to recall it's entire make up, but going from memory I'd say it was 60% minority on the conservative side. My Senior Developers were Black, White Hispanic and Indian. They were male and female. They were extremely talented, dedicated, eager and curious about each others professional and personal journey's.

## Diversity === Perspective

This rang true at almost all my places of employment. The more diverse the team or company was, the more we all learned about the world outside of the next meet-up. I learned to be tolerant, patient and empathetic.

I'm no saint. Ask around, I can be a very crass and cold individual. That's just me. But working with people who don't always look, dress, and sound like me has helped shaped who I am today.

## Black, Brown, White and Orange

When I hear people complain about diversity on Twitter, I sometimes swivel my chair around and would look upon my team. The team that 5 years ago, was 4 white guys and guy from Bangledesh. Fast forward to present day, and we're 15 persons strong.
