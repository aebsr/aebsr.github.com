An ’80s baby and male, hailing from the DMV. That’s D.C. by birth, Maryland by choice and Virginia by hell or high water.

> Purveyor of quirky verbosity, parables and dope rhymes.

I've been making the web for over 12 years. The last 3 of which have been at [HZ](http://hzdg.com) as a Senior Front End Developer.

I've managed creative teams at The Federal Highway Administration and The Performance Institute. I've worked for startups including [Personal](http://personal.com), [TravelShark](http://travelshark.com) and [PaySimple](http://paysimple.com). I've worked with agencies such as [AKQA](http://akqa.com), [nclud](http://nclud.com), [EightShapes](http://eightshapes.com) and [Probonafide](http://probonafide.com).

Larger brands that I've worked with have included [Washington Redskins](http://www.hzdg.com/work/redskins/), Volkswagen, [King Arthur Flour](http://www.hzdg.com/work/king-arthur), Webex, [Hilton](http://hzdg.tumblr.com/post/63650525553/hilton-hotels-resorts-hilton-hotels-resorts) and [USPS](http://usps.com).

## Outside of Work

My wife and kids keep me busy. Between soccer, karate, gymnastics and diapers, I try to fit in at least one date night every other week. When not otherwise committed, I'll spend my time making music (my first passion), exercising or at the range -- think gun powder, not golf balls.

There are few things beyond family, music and the web that I am passionate about.

### Social?

Best places to reach me are [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/aebsr) if you're not a recruiter, [Twitter](http://twitter.com/aebsr) for general purpose, and [rdio](http://www.rdio.com/people/aebsr/).
