This past Saturday marked the 7th annual Blue Beanie Day [#BBD13](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BBD13&src=hash). A day meant to celebrate web standards, it's practitioners as well as the man and book that showed us all the promise land. [Jeffrey Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com/)'s [Designing With Web Standards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designing_with_Web_Standards) (DWWS).

I got my hands on the book in 2005. It motivated me to abandon tables and flash as my tools of choice. This new adoration for the semantic web lead me to embrace find-ability and accessibility as well. The skills, techniques and methodologies that DWWS exposed me to are what has gotten me to where I am today. I went from making niche sites that served very specific and diminutive audiences to running the development efforts of a non partisan, private think tank seemingly overnight.

In todays climate, where every other thought leader has a book; every rock star has a community lauded plugin or tool; and everyone else has a blog it's easy to overlook or forget the significance of that book. Because without DWWS, would there have been [Handcrafted CSS](http://handcraftedcss.com/), [Responsive Web Design](http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design) or [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/)?

Some debate it's relevance and scoff at the idea of a day dedicated to that iconic beanie, I instead choose to remember how it motivated me and helped shaped my view of the web. More importantly, I think of the many people who enter our field of choice and still choose DWWS as one of their first 'must reads'.

Shout out to **everyone** who followed it's lead and contributed to our community in a lasting way.
