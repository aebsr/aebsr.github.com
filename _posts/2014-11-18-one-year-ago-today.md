Last year, I asked you to [Allow Me To Re-introduce Myself](/2013/11/18/allow-me-to-reintroduce-myself/) as I tried to commit to blogging more -- not just about code and design, but also about our tech community. A year later, I can confirm: Blogging is still hard.

This time, however, I can only attribute this to lack of free time. Like so many in tech, I have ideas for days but little time to flesh them out. And while there are those recently who would call that lazy or see it as a [lack of commitment to our profession](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html), I instead see it as a commitment to staying who I am: A husband and father of three, a hip-hop head, a man with too many hobbies for his own good, and a person committed to pushing social change and promoting the benefits of diversity. All of which add to my value as a developer, an employee, and a still reluctant citizen of our tech community.

Since this time last year, I've written 16 posts, including this one, which in part have provided me the opportunity to speak at my first [CSS Conference](http://cssconf.com), write a column in [Net Magazine](http://www.creativebloq.com/netmag/issue-258-81412615), and get a shout out in [Smashing Newsletter](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/smashing-newsletter-issue-118/#a6). Trying to keep that forward momentum, I'm working on a talk for next year.

My posts have varied from [off beat](/2014/05/29/poetic-semantics/) to [experimental](/2014/01/28/apple-calendar/), [inspirational](/2014/10/14/less-product-more-process/) and [principled](/2014/01/23/principles-and-plantations/). Perhaps my favorite so far, though, is this one, as I'm reminded how a little effort can expose you to so much.

## Room For Improvement

I've made few appearances at DC Tech meetups though, which is something I'd hoped to improve upon. I've also avoided blogging about more personal takeaways from our greater tech community. That all should change soon. There's so much I've wanted to say, but have chosen to not share due to lack of clarity.

## You Should Write, Unless You Shouldn't

To anyone else out there who wants to blog, meet up, open source, or speak: Go for it. If it doesn't work out or you end up falling short, it's ok. Because doing **all the things** that make you happy is what makes you an awesome person. Why settle for just being an awesome developer?
