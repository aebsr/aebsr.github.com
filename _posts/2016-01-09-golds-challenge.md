## Say Cheese

"I'm done now right?" I thought.

No.

It's time to take my Before photo. Because how else am I to show the world or at least the Gold's Gym Challenge judges how far I've come. So off my shirt went. I pulled my shoulders back and fixed my posture. I took a deep breathe and relaxed my stomach. Then my Fitness Consultant said _"Just let it all hang out"_.

And I did. The camera went snap. My shirt went back on. I haven't seen the photo and don't plan to, for 3 months. Because god dammit, I've got work to do.
