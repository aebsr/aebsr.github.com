There's no time like the present. Covered in sweat at my standing desk, reflecting on my ad hoc workout. I've spent the lion's share of the day couch locked in my pajamas fending off a migraine. Unable to commit to the 5-minute drive to the gym, I decided put on sneakers and skip for 30 minutes with a weighted jump rope.

Once done, in the middle of patting myself on the back for my dedication, perseverance and focus I thought - "How far off is this behavior from that which got me in this unfit state to begin with?" Approaching fitness with no care for my deteriorating knees, my inflamed rib cage and my now fragile ankles and wrists.

You see, I'm addict. Arguably, most athletes are as well. Though I wouldn't take on that title. Not yet at least. While I've conquered my addiction to caffeine and tobacco I've spent a lot of time trying to regain my addiction to working out. I'm not chasing injury again, but I am chasing fitness. Wiser and hopefully more aware of my weaknesses, I can use my addictive personality for good.
