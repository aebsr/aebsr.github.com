---

I’ve finally come down from the high that was [CSS Conf
2014](http://2014.cssconf.com/). Most conferences I’ve attended target hybrid, designer/developer types. CSS Conf had a focused
development role in mind. Over the years, Photoshop has become a product I consume instead of a tool I used to create. That's what
made attending CSS Conf refreshing, and also made speaking, *for the
first time*, so humbling.

[Nicole Sullivan](https://twitter.com/stubbornella), [Lea
Verou](https://twitter.com/leaverou),
[Laura](https://twitter.com/lwilliams) and [Chris
Williams](https://twitter.com/voodootikigod) organized the event as part
of [JS Conf](http://2014.jsconf.us/). They, and the attendees, were beyond
supportive. I can only speak for myself, but that energy and focus on
inclusiveness were key to surviving my 20 or so minutes on stage.

The venue, Amelia Island, was beautiful. I only wish more conferences
chose locations with family friendliness in mind.
That said, try as I did, the
[plantation](http://aeb.sr/2014/01/23/principles-and-plantations/)
references as part of the Resort’s branding frustrated me. I
mean damn, why did the best-tasting frozen drink on the property have to include the word
*plantation* too?

Everyone Should Speak

Besides promoting diversity, I wanted to speak for many reasons. Though in the
end, I wanted spread the gospel that more people should be thinking
beyond the width of their browsers. In other words, [Embrace The
Vertical](http://speakerdeck.com/aebsr/embrace-the-vertical).

Here’s the rub. It’s a hell of a lot harder to write your talk, make the
slides and commit your thoughts to memory than it is to get up in front
of people and just talk. For me, it’s like flying. You’re already in the
air, there’s no point in panicking.

The speaker bug has bitten me. I’ve gotten feedback and am itching to do it
all again. I want to update my slides, speak more confidently and maybe
even share the stage with a couple more of my web design heroes. I’ll
get to that the moment my Github issue list is down to single digits.

My Favorite Sessions
--------------------

There were three major running themes: component-driven development,
performance, and CSS colors. Of the 11 talks, I’ll review the ones that
for me as a developer were most actionable. One caveat: I was too
stressed about my own talk to put pen to paper during everyone else’s.
[Susan Lin](http://twitter.com/bysusanlin) made some
[sketch-notes](http://sketch.bysusanlin.com/post/87208280133/sketchnotes-from-cssconf-1-of-2-morning-session)
that helped bring all the awesome details back to the surface. Plus one
for creative note-taking!

### Style Guide Driven Development

I walked away from [Nicole Sullivan](https://twitter.com/stubbornella)’s
talk saying, “Everything is a component.” We’ve been building an internal
tool at [HZ](http://hzdg.com) that this approach is ready made for.
Building and documenting components in a way that anyone can work with
and reuse them is an attractive goal.

### [CSS Testing](http://cburgmer.github.io/csscritic/cssconf2014/)

[Christoph Burgmer](https://twitter.com/cburgmer) provided great CSS
testing use cases, tools and other resources in
[csste.st](http://csste.st). His talk will help me convert our human-powered QA process into a partially automated one. His principles on
testing with Nicole’s style guides could make for easy regression
testing.

### [Bulletproof Font Icons](http://filamentgroup.com/lab/bulletproof_icon_fonts.html)

[Zach Leatherman](https://twitter.com/zachleat)’s talk should be
considered required watching by any new front end engineer. If you’re
familiar with fighting FOUT, you’ll find helpful tips and unique
perspectives on font icons -- such as the differences in behavior between
the two and little-known details on browser support.

### Parallax Performance

[Paul Irish](https://twitter.com/paul_irish)’s talk on scroll
performance was timely, insightful and all-around impressive. No
surprise there. Also, thanks for giving all those “non parallax”
scrolling experiences their own name.
“[Parallax](http://fueled.com/blog/the-troublesome-misconception-of-parallax-in-webdesign/)”
as a term was becoming the
“[HTML5](http://jeffcroft.com/blog/2010/aug/02/term-html5/)” of 2014.

### [Animating SVGs With CSS](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Iuvf3saPCJepVJBDNNDSmSsA0_rwtRYehSmmSSLYFVQ/)

I have yet to explore the depths of what SVGs can do but [Sara
Soueidan](http://sarasoueidan.com/)’s talk equipped me with the tools to
start digging. Worth noting was her presence and strength of knowledge
on the subject. It was a refreshing a validating win for diversity in
the tech space.

Moving Forward
--------------

I’ll be reviewing recent projects and looking for potential case studies
to speak on. I also plan to put a renewed energy in to publishing my
thoughts on front end technologies.

Nicole and Chris have sort of re-inspired me to give back to the
community in my own special way. I don’t have the bandwidth or desire to
host a conference but hell, why not put the leg work in for a new DC
Meetup?
