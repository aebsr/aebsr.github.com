> Donâ€™t write a lot. Just write often.<br />

I'm going to borrow that and use it as my online mantra for the next year. Away from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aebsr), I've been pretty quiet online, but today I hope that changes. While I'm sitting on maybe a dozen unfinished posts from last year that focus primarily on diversity in tech, I'm instead choosing to diversify my subject matter.

I'll try to keep them short and imperfect. I'll write about family, politics, technology, hobbies and music. I'll post poems, songs and stories.

Every. Damn. Day.

And I'll try my damnedest to keep up with my Hip Hop derivative wordplay. After all...

> Sometimes I don't write a lot<br />
> I know some folks call that writers block<br />
> I just call it my process<br />
> It comes out when it's ready to I guess<br />
> I don't wanna let nobody down so<br />
> Here's some new shit you tell me how it sounds<br />
> I ain't trying to be difficult or no shit<br />
> It just hurts too bad to try to force it<br />
