Those that know me, know I enjoy silly little challenges. There's typically some meaningful back story but the challenges tend to all spawn from a kind "I wonder if I can" conversation. This constant attempt to strengthen will power is what allowed me to quit smoking some six years ago, quick caffeine twice for over a year each, go vegetarian for a month every December and go Pescatarian for few months this year.

My latest challenge is to get my body fat down to around [18%](/2016/03/10/32-days/). That means putting on 15lbs of muscle and losing around 40lbs of fat. Turns out, accomplishing that requires me to take a break on some older challenges.

## Welcome Back Old Friends

It is with mild regret and renewed motivation I embrace some old vices.

## Caffeine

Walking through Wegmans with my wife (how do you like that alliteration) when I suggested going back to caffeine after 15 months. I quit - 80% because I'm an [addict](/2016/01/03/the-thin-fit-line/) and 20% if I'm being honest, because I just enjoyed conqouring something that so many people were a slave to. Yeah, I felt better than. But at my worst I was consuming 613g of caffeine a day, not counting the chocolate covered coffee beans I'd snack on at night to pull all-nighters.

Caffeine though does offer me two things that would help losing this weight. Energy to finish workouts and a brief metabolic boost. So to try and avoid going back down that slippery slope I'm only consuming about 65g of caffeine via infused water once a day before a workout.

## Meat

Despite feeling better and having a little more energy, one thing the body struggles to do without steady sources of protein is build muscle. So my Pescatarian diet has to take a break. Otherwise I've got no chance of eating the 116g-225g of protein my body will need, because I don't like fish THAT much.

This perhaps will be the easiest thing to drop again though. Everytime I have pork or even a large serving a red meat I don't feel 100%. I feel stronger during workouts but everything else feels just a bit off. So I look very forward to going back to veggies, shrimp and crab legs this fall.
