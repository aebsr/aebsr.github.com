7 Elementary Schools, 2 Middle Schools and 1 High School. That's where over a hundred students hailed from for a wintery band performance. Midway through the performance I noticed an animated woman to the side of the stage. I learned that she was in fact signing the instrumental music for a deaf family. Something that I didn't know existed.

Later I found a video of a young man exhibiting how to communicate instrumental music with ASL.

I watched this woman sign almost 2 hours of music and interludes for this family. It reminded me of a task often part of my job as a Front End Developer: Making websites and web apps accessible. That means  making sure that persons with disabilities are able to make use of, and consume information on things I help build.

This task isn't always seen as such a noble venture. In stead, it's seen as a burden. A tedious time and budget suck. When in fact is often a moral imperative. After all, there are more people with limited vision than there are people with 4K and Retina desktop monitors. Listen to a blind person try and book a flight [as I did](http://www.accessibilitycampdc.org/) and you'll have a better appreciation for how simple tasks are made worst by those who don't go the extra step.

That's what surprised me most about the woman at the band performance. The ability to take part in the listening experience isn't a right or a necessity. But it is a part of being human. It's pretty dope that because of her efforts, that family was able to enjoy some aspect of the performance along with everyone else in the room.

Sharing the experience online, my friend [Andrew](https://twitter.com/andrewcohen) put me onto [Amber Galloway Gallego](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAg6N0lO0_4gtU-v5U8_vfw). Whom uses her love of music and excellent skill with ASL to bring the lyrics and energy of popular music to deaf fans.
