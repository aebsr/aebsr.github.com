Here's my late follow up to last year's [Code The Block](/2014/12/11/code-the-block/). Below are a half assed attempt at sharing music that powered a year of code. Since I don't drink caffeine any more I have to credit music with 100% of my productivity.

The lion share of mainstream artists continue to lack substance and I just don't have the time these days to dig through the crates. Or more accurately, crawl through the online waste and find those musical gems. As an art form and culture, Hip Hop remains healthy and diverse. As usual though, the loudest voice in the room is rarely the one worth listening to.

Join me on a random day of hip hop fueled development in 2015.

## Keep The Feel
It's chilly outside so it's harder than usual to skip the coffee, or at least something warm and comforting. I slip into the office early through the back door, moving leisurely with "Walk Slower Daddy" in my headphones.

Emails are checked and I've got 4 terminal windows up and running. I CMD+T my way to GitHub to see a new set of issues begging for my attention. It's time to get it in and start hitting those keys.

## Heart Of The City
It's 10AM now and the office are nearly full. The lights are all on and I've gotta get more serious, with conversations about our weekends vying for my attention.

Stomach grumbling, but it's too soon for lunch. I've resolved one merge conflict too many and the lead designer has been waiting for me to make it over to his desk for an hour now. I can't stop now though. There's only one more issue assigned to me, then I can get back to performance testing this single page app.

## Future Vintage
That convo with the lead designer wasn't so bad. You know, besides the complete redesign of those components I've already built. Guess I've got more work to do before lunch. Headphones back on and it's head down until the lunch train starts making it's way out of the Development pit.

## Deeply Rooted
Lunch was decent. Filling. Quick. I kind of need a change of atmosphere at this point though. My day has been a bit too, how should I say it... bright. Time to get back to my roots.

By now, I'm head down and dancing at my desk for the first time today. It's back to my bread and butter, PSD to HTML conversions. Oh what's that, you need these templates by end of day. Yeah, I can do that. No problem.

## Wave[s]
Clients just walked by and saw me bouncing around at my make shift standing desk. Their nervous gaze makes me think, maybe I should change the pace for a bit.

Working myself back up to rapid development mode I turn up the headphones for one of last years favorite MCs.

## Professional Rapper
> A day without laughter is a day wasted. <br /> - *Charlie Chaplin*

I can't seem to find any stand up albums that keeps me engaged, so let me kill two birds with one skinny white stone.

Now I get to exercise my past experience as a designer. Given the freedom to design in the browser, content first. Tweaking components of an undesigned "tablet" state for this responsive UI. It's often cheaper and faster to leave it in the hands of your friendly neighborhood dapper developer.

## To Pimp a Butterfly
Looks like I didn't pace out my day too well. I'm briefly taken a back to my more militant days. Before I moved to the burbs. Before I understood exactly how dangerous homogeneity is. I'm distracted from my task at hand and forced to think about what I've grown so tired of thinking about. So tired of experiencing. So tired of seeing on Twitter. I skip a few tracks because I'm not in the emotional state where I can focus on everything being said and then I'm reminded, we gon be alright.

My heart is racing, steadily hitting those keys. Swiping between screens comparing templates in Chrome and IE10. Trying desperately to focus on my work and not on my own thoughts and internal struggles. The dichotomy is too thick to ignore. Surrounded by white faces in a largely white industry in a largely white town in a time where people who look like me are being killed in the streets by those sworn to protect and those that I would call brother.

It's cool though...

> I done been through a whole lot<br />
Trial, tribulation, but I know God<br />
The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie<br />
Pray that the holy water don't go dry<br />
As I look around me<br />
So many motherfuckers wanna down me<br />
But an enemigo never drown me<br />
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me<br />
And I love myself<br />

## The Incredible True Story
I can see the light at the end of the tunnel just as fatigue is taking it's toll. Everyone else is relying on that afternoon coffee to push them through to the end of the day. That's when I look to a local guy gone famous to defy the sophomore slump as he helps my anguish fade away.

With my mood improved, the melodic instrumentals and rapid flow of Logic makes it easy to code without thinking too much. So I'm back to _mostly_ emotionless, hip hop powered web development for another hour.

It's power hour. I'm leaving the office at 6 on the dot and I've got to keep myself in my seat. I'm tired of looking at this screen and would much rather shoot the shit with my office BFF. So I take to twitter and reach out to my hip hop network provide with just the write piece of music to get me to the end of the day. Today though, I came up empty handed.
