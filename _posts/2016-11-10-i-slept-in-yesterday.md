My 11 year old son met my wife at the front door in tears.

"Is it true?"

At an elementary school bus stop, two girls meet in a quiet panic. A hispanic girl asking "What are we going to do?" A black girl responds with a shrug and helpless nod of her head.

I'm up now. On the road, taking my 4 year old to preschool. He's oblivious to our new reality. He calls me a [Bergen](http://www.dreamworks.com/trolls/explore/bergens). I call him a Troll. It's business as usual.

Back at the bus stop, a white stay at home mom shares a tearful embrace with a black neighbor.

A few miles away, students in a middle school erupt into chants of "Fuck Trump". Their anger masks their sadness and fear.

I've got my feet up and headphones on. Drowning out the news in the background. I'm listening to Brother Ali's "Mourning In America".

> My dear Brother Ali, I think you know deep down in your soul that something, something just ain't right.You don't want to be just well adjusted to injustice and well adapted to indifference. You want to be a person with integrity who leaves a mark on the world.People can say when you go that you left the world just a little better than you found it. I understand. I want to be like that too. â€“ [Letter To My Countrymen](http://genius.com/Brother-ali-letter-to-my-countrymen-lyrics)

The Twitter outrage is tiring. The news' perspective is redundant. The idea of America, is burning.

I don't feel the flames.

By now my son is home and doing homework, bursts into sudden tears.

"I don't want to move."

I tell him, in many more words than this:

"Your grandmother raised me on her own in Regan Era Washington, DC. YOU, are going to be [alright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-48u_uWMHY)."

## I've Got Work To Do

Today, I have a renewed energy. I'll say today, what I didn't have the patience or presence of mind and body to say yesterday.

### Son,

It's OK to feel deeply. Your mother has a huge heart and you get that from her. I'm going to tell you something, but I need you to understand this is coming from me. A man who let's his heart take a back seat to all things. â€“ Nothing has changed.

Barack Obama was still our President or 8 years. You can still be anything you imagine. You are still a strong, caring, and hard working young man. Your teachers are still committed to giving you the best education they can. Your mother and I have still but one priority. To still give you and your siblings everything we never had growing up.

Nothing has changed.

There are still bigots in this world and those that may wish you economic and physical harm. You still have my unwavering support to shut that shit down and defend yourself by any means necessary. Though you still have to surrender your rights in the presence of any police officer who may perceive you as a threat, because mom and dad want you to come home. We still live in America, and will do so for as long as we can.

Nothing has changed.

### Daughter,

Take a deep breath and repeat after me. Everything. Is. Going. To. Be. OK.
Remember that time you had a sleep over, when you and your friends made your own nail polish? Everyone chose shades of pink and purple, except you. You chose a soft shade of brown with sparkles. One friend scoffed at your choice, "Ew. Brown?" you didn't hesitate. Defiant, you replied "What's wrong with brown? I like brown. It's the color of my skin."

I could see the wheels turning as your friend tilted her head and with a sort of nod there was an unspoken agreement. There is nothing wrong with brown. There's nothing wrong with celebrating what makes you, you. There's nothing wrong with being different. Keep doing that, and we'll be OK.

You don't need people to like you. You don't need people to agree with you. You only need to be confident enough to be you. Let the gravity of your awesome surround you with the support of those that are worthy of your love.

It won't be easy, and that's OK.

### Wife,

Months ago, we sat on our balcony in the middle of the Bahamas reflecting on how far we've come. The hard work and sacrifice of our mother's validated in every move we make. We're use to worker harder and longer and paying the preverbal black tax. We don't complain. We don't wallow. We perceiver. As the words inked on my forearms read, we are "Butler Strong" and can weather any storm fortune sends our way.

_Now let me keep it ðŸ’¯._

## Let Me Remind You Who The Fuck I Am

Friends and colleagues,

I like it hard. Pressure and stress, though undesired and unfair is the foundation on which I'm built. You are the sum of those  around you. If you consider me close to your heart, don't waste my presence. Whenever you are in doubt or afraid, call me. I'll stuff your feelings in a deep hole to be unearthed when our society rebukes hate. I'll help you work on  a plan to effect change.

I'll show up. I'll march. I'll protect. I'll fight.

Trump doesn't scare me. Neither do his racists cohorts. Neither do his sexist rapey apologists.

What scares me?

The idea what we would let this new regressive and oppressive government steal our voice. That we let the bigots feel so empowered they infringe on our rights. This is the kindle that lights the fire under our collective asses.

I scolded a friend years ago for being a bystander. They rebuked my dissent, claiming I can feel this way because of "who I am". That some how my presence, my past, or my appearance makes it easier to stand tall. Easier to act. Easier to take the hit.

No. I don't accept that. The reality is, all you need to put yourself out there is the balls (read: ovaries) to take the hit.

So as much as it frustrates me to put myself out there in the public space, here we are. I'll be spending the lion share of the next 4 years getting ready for the next 8 years. I'm thinking about that those middle schoolers now. I'm thinking about what can we do to put them in a position to effect change in 8 years.

I want to go to each of them and tell them; don't chant, vote; don't rebel, infiltrate; don't complain, act.

So look to future friends. Who can you teach? Who can you mentor? Who can you inspire?

I don't have time to grieve.

Organize.

Resist.

Dry your tears, and get to work.
