Bear with me. I'm going to write like I think, and -- outside of the professional space -- much like I speak. My pace is rabid and jerky. My tone is crude and eccentric. I'm verbose, yet hate verbosity. I loathe editing, because if I wanted to sound a certain way, I'd say it that way. Well-organized thoughts, personal and professional, are the exception. I think and speak as a draft. My wife, Kelley, edits away the noise.

## This One Time, In Middle School

I wrote a short novel. Now, it's called a novella. "It has potential," my English teacher said. So, I rewrote it as half sequel, half reboot. The same teacher insisted I must have had help. Still unsatisfied, I rewrote the story a third time. The characters were more complex and mature than my eighth grade teachers expected or were willing to accept. The setting, detailed and fanciful. The conflicts, riddled with age inappropriate violence. This third and final version of my novella I delivered to my English and History teachers. They took it home. Held on to it for a few days. My English teacher finally returned it, imploring me to write more. My history teacher refused to accept I had written this story on my own.

That was the last piece of long-form written work I have ever completed. The world and the characters I created consumed my subconscious. I was a slave to my fiction. Frustrated, I destroyed my creations. Not a single page preserved. The entire saga lives on as a fading memory of what once was. Since then, I write with a weight on my chest. This pressure to be as good as, if not better than, I once was or could have been. A pressure to not lose my reality in my fiction. A pressure to finish. These pressures impede passion. The cruel irony is, I have a passion for passions.

When I tell people the story of my novellas, it's the path from one version to the next that excites me. Not the destroyed books.

## It Was a Warm Summer's Night

Imagine I told you, about the then performance of my lifetime. Atop the balcony in a DC Night Club performing a 15-minute set. In my retelling, I'd omit the names of most of the songs performed. They don't matter compared to the night itself. A story worth telling is about the process, not the execution. The journey, not the destination. Despite these truths, I've kept my creative works in a dark cellar of doubt for the past decade.

I've written songs, but haven't recorded them. Recorded songs, but haven't released them. I've started novellas, but not finished them. I've built applications, but kept them private. I've written blog posts that were never published.

At some point, I became afraid to fail. Or worse, afraid to try. I could blame my finish-less streak on a busy career, but that's an unworthy excuse. As would be pointing the finger at my active and busy family. The fault is on me, for believing the lie that is adulthood. "There's never enough time." Because only well-rested minds with time to waste can make something creative and successful.

## To The Makers

Here's to caring less about the end products. The stories no one reads. The songs no one listens to. The applications only I use. The shirts no one buys. Here's to the pleasure found in putting pen to paper. Here's to the camaraderie in the studio with friends. Here's to the tiny applications I use every day. Here's to the t-shirt that I'll buy 20 of just to see it printed.

From here on, I'll make an effort to release whatever I make. Readiness is relative. I will create for the sake of creation. Because the process is the story, and the product a footnote.
