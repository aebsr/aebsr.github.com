description: "A little something not worth writing."

It only took five days for me to be too tired to write anything. I mean, this counts. Maybe. It's kind of a cheat though, right? Is writing about not writing any less of a writing task? In the end I'm just putting thoughts to pen... or screen, if you will.

So what's the take away? I need to go to sleep. I need to write earlier in the day. I need to hit save and publish this shit as fast as possible. It's almost midnight after all.
