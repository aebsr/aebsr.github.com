[An Event Apart](http://archive.aneventapart.com/events/2008/chicago/) was the first technology conference I ever attended back in 2008. [And](http://archive.aneventapart.com/2009/chicago/) [five](http://archive.aneventapart.com/2010/dc/) [more](http://archive.aneventapart.com/2011/sanfrancisco/) [Events](http://aneventapart.com/event/washington-dc-2013) [later](http://aneventapart.com/event/washington-dc-2016) I find myself often being asked – "Why do you come back?".

The short answer is, to be inspired.

## The Other Guys

I love conferences. The networking, education and let's be honest, the traveling is awesome. An Event Apart however has always provided me a concentrated dose of inspiration. It's where I met some long time friends, met mentors and was even motivated to [speak](/2014/02/21/to-css-conf-we-go/) myself. It's fair to say, I may have never made my way to CSS Conf, Edge Conf or South By South West without the positive experiences at An Event Apart.

## One of This Years Themes: Empathy

Jeffrey kicked off the day as usual by reminding us that our job over the years hasn't changed all that much. And in his message to do better, be better and expect better he turned his focus to accessibility.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">RE: Accessibility - “Phrase it in the negative and see if it’s OK with you.” eg “We don’t care about ____ so they can’t use our site” <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/aeadc?src=hash">#aeadc</a></p>&mdash; Antoine Butler [@aebsr] <a href="https://twitter.com/aebsr/status/757570052191350788">July 25, 2016</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s no surprise that we, who spend so much time behind expensive screens decorating the interwebs need be reminded to be empathetic. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/aeadc?src=hash">#aeadc</a></p>&mdash; Antoine Butler (@aebsr) <a href="https://twitter.com/aebsr/status/757939924914040832">July 26, 2016</a></blockquote>

A few talks danced in and out of accessibility, usability and decency. The common thread, empathy. Which Eric expertly and very personally made clear.

## Another Theme: Extremes

> Yes yes y'all, I still fiend by any means /
To flow, and I go through extremes don't intervene /
My adventures show like a three dimensional screen /
Cause I mention many things and I'm presentin many scenes -- [When I'm Flowin](http://genius.com/Rakim-when-im-flowin-lyrics)

[Eric](https://twitter.com/meyerweb) and [Derek](https://twitter.com/feather) drove this point home for me. We don't have to always think about worst case circumstances but instead just ask ourselves, "How might what I'm making hurt someone?"

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">re: `edge cases` — “Where you ‘stress test’ your work, you find out where it is weak.” — <a href="https://twitter.com/meyerweb">@meyerweb</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/aeadc?src=hash">#aeadc</a></p>&mdash; Antoine Butler (@aebsr) <a href="https://twitter.com/aebsr/status/757968971471749120">July 26, 2016</a></blockquote>

It seems like a silly question, after-all we only make websites. But people interact with all different types of websites and interfaces for a multitude of reasons. Some of which aren't pleasant. It's our responsibility to serve them as best we can. This is something addressed not only in UX design and code; but also in editorial direction and tone.

To avoid getting lost in the rabbit hole of what if's when thinking about how users may negatively interact with what you make, Derek compelled us to simply think in extremes. Could Andre the Giant use your UI? Could a blind person navigate your DOM? Could ____ do ____?  I won't spoil it for you, but the answer is often No, and the fix rarely requires much effort if approached with an open mind and identified early.
