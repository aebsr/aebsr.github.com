I've spent years in search of the perfect wallet. Dramatic, I know. But the search continues.

## The MVP

No, not the most valuable. I mean, the most minimal [viable product]. Enter: The [Dollar Wallet](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/simplefactorync/the-dollar-wallet-made-in-the-usa/description)

While I loved it initially for it's simplicity and light weight, it eventually proved insufficient with the wood bending and the cloth band eventually unraveling into a messy series of loose threads. It was $1 though, so maybe that should have been expected.

## The Real MVP

The [Machine Era Wallet](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/189943599/machine-era-wallet/description) what the piece de resistance for some time. The craftsmanship alone was worth the purchase. It's a comfortable weight, just enough to notice if it was removed from your pocket. The band is solid and durable. It's flexible enough to _almost_ as few and as many cards as I'd need on any given day.

Two years later the band has gotten to be a bit loose and the metal edges, though rounded, have taken a toll on my jeans. My back pocket is almost completely useless. I've actually had to return to putting in my front pocket as a result.

## The Back Up

[Simple](https://www.simple.com/friends/CMYYQKV) had perfect timing when they sent me a new card which came with their own freebie minimal wallet. A cardboard base with a durable rubber band.

This will have to do until I can find something better.

## The Classic

Turns out, I think this new trend of minimal, thin, band based wallets is flawed. The more I use mine the more I wonder who their target audience really is. While I can on occasion traverse my city with just my ID and debit card in hand, the moment I need more adding cards becomes a burden.

The moment I forget to grab my credit card heading to the Apple Store, or my HSA card on the way to the pharmacy, or my metro card when I'm taking the train - I think, "I didn't just leave it in there last time".

While these band based wallets can hold quite a bit of cards they aren't meant to. It goes against the minimal mantra. So let's assume ID and credit card are the bare minimum for walking around for the typical millennial. Oh but my CC is an Amex and I've been to one too many shops that don't accept it, so I keep a back up on hand. As a parent, can I responsibly go about the world without proof of Insurance? No. So I'm up to 4 cards. Do you carry your debit card, metro card or something else daily? Because if so you've reached the uncomfortable point for band based wallets. There's room, but flipping through the cards held tightly while at the register gets old.

I'm convinced that the classic bifold wallet is where it's at. I want a thin and durable wallet that gives me quick access to a reasonable amount of cards. A wallet that doesn't make the rare occassion of carrying business cards or cash a hassle. A balance between design, function and craftsmanship. I'm hoping the [Articulate Money Clip](http://articulatelifestyle.com/collections/money-clips-2015) is the answer. Ideal for 4 to 6 plastic cards, business cards and optionally cash.

Before you suggest it, I'm not a fan of combo wallets. I'm not interested in losing my credit card and phone at the same time.

I did it for the strip<br />
Canâ€™t you see me coming<br />
Thick bitties in the buggy<br />
Pitch black tinted windows<br />
Sitting on the money clip<br />

What's your favorite wallet? Is there something else I should be looking into?
