Guess I should officially call this series of posts "semi daily", because I didn't write anything yesterday. But again, with good reason. I spent the day on my stomach in Wild and Wonderful West Virginia.

> Sorry I'm late.

Oh, was that a creepy description of my day? My bad. So yeah I was getting some ink therapy. Courtesy of [TJ Link](http://www.100prooftattoo.com/tj-link.html) over at [100 Proof Tattoo](http://www.100prooftattoo.com). He took on the difficult task of completing someone else's work on my forearm tattoos. Which have spent the last year unfinished. I've gone from 40% complete to 98% in one day - which is pretty impressive.

When done, I avoided stopping at the casino (humble brag) but was held up getting dinner for [Kelley](http://twitter.com/kelleymbutler) and I. With sore arms and a full belly, so began **The Ballad of Late**.

## My Youngest

> Sorry I'm late.

Is how my toddler started this morning. Walking into daycare and greeting the room with an apology for his late arrival. The care taker looks at me and says "He is just too grown". Indeed, in some ways at least.

Oh the dichotomy.

I realized then that today marks just over a week that he's been wearing his big boy briefs all day without issue. I would have loved for that to have happened about 5 months ago but alas... he was late.

## My Eldest

My son is destined to become a vegetarian. If it's not pasta or cheese, he generally has no interest in it. The exception being chicken nuggets. Every attempt to expand his palate was met with fear and disgust. That is, until recently.

> Sorry I'm late.

A few weeks ago, distracted by a game he requested a cheeseburger instead of nuggets. Surprise, he liked it. Like a lot. Like, he hasn't had chicken nuggets since.

A few days ago, he decided to try Subway sandwich. Ordering ham for the first time in years. He like it. Like a lot.

Today he upped his game combining turkey and ham, with mustard. Mustard, another ingredient he previously loathed. He finished his sandwich saying "I think next time, I'll try tomato".

I don't know what's gotten into this kid, but I love it. First stop Subway, final stop Indian Buffet.
