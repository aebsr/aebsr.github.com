A collection of things I've written and made elsewhere online.

- ## [Embrace The Vertical](http://2014.cssconf.com/)
  I'll be speaking at CSS Conf in May 2014
- ## [Lucid Jekyll Theme](http://aeb.sr/lucid-jekyll-theme/)
  A simple, content first Jekyll theme.
- ## [Git Checkout Orphan](https://coderwall.com/p/k7h0ma)
  This little alias will automate git checkout of orphan branches
- ## [Intrinsic Ratio Less Mixin](https://coderwall.com/p/jn8xlw)
  A flexible LESS mixin that quickly creates intrinsic ratios
- ## PrintFancy.com
  Resurrecting the oft forgotten print style sheet. As seen on [DotEduGuru](http://doteduguru.com/id3876-dont-loose-your-identity-create-an-effective-print-style-sheet.html) and [Good vs Great Design](http://www.slideshare.net/cameronmoll/good-vs-great-design). Also here's a years' worth of [@printfancy](http://twitter.com/printfancy) [twitter archive](https://twitter.com/search?q=%40printfancy&src=typd&f=realtime).
