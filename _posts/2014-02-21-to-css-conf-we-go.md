Time to put up or shut up, because my talk ‘proposal’ for [CSS Conf](http://2014.cssconf.com/) has been accepted.

### Embrace The Vertical

The plan is to discuss opportunities, risks and the potential future of height -based media queries. Screens move in both directions, but we almost always deal in width. Through site reviews, prototypes and UI experiments, I will showcase why these media queries are ready for prime time — somehow in 30 minutes.

### The _Everything_ For Which There Is A First Time

I’ve discussed ideas, concepts and code over lunch. I’ve walked others through tricky CSS problems and browser inconsistencies. I’ve spoken in front of  the design and development teams at [HZ](http://hzdg.com/). I have not, however, done [this](http://weareallaweso.me/for_speakers/index.html): stand in front of strangers in an attempt to educate, persuade and encourage discussion.

That said, the bulk of what I hope to discuss is outlined. Prototypes, websites and use cases are plentiful. I was surprised when CSSConf announced my talk, and attendees  requested specific issues for me to address. Though I can’t promise I can get to them all, I’d love for you to [join the conversation](https://ti.to/jsconf-us/cssconf-us-2014) this May 27th.

### Wisdom Imparted

My [wife](http://twitter.com/kelleymbutler), seasoned in the art of public speaking, calmed any potential nerves by sharing with me her “Surefire Three-Step Plan For Success In Public Speaking.”

1.  Do a shot 10 mins before going on stage.
2.  As they’re reading your intro, stand backstage in a Superman pose.
3.  When they call your name, say to yourself in your best Sam Jackson voice, “You’re god damn right, I’m [insert name here]. You people aren’t fucking ready.”

When I expressed disbelief that the drink was indeed part of her  speaking-engagement prep she assured me:

> “Kahlua and coffee or a mimosa if it’s an a.m. session. A standard shot of tequila if it’s anytime after lunch. Not enough to be drunk. Just enough to tell the butterflies to STFU.”
