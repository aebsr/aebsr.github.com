As a kid I ran. Down the block, across the street, and up the stairs. Even through the hall, when my Grandma and Mom werenâ€™t home at least.
There were no fields, pools or up kept courts at my disposal. On the television Sport was shaped by burgundy and gold tights and eagle feathers; sometimes blue outstretched hands grasping for a ball. *You know you're __from__ DC if you got that.*

Golf, soccer, tennis and golf were, dare I say it -- Sports white people played. If only because they had access, because they could see people who looked like them play and excel at them.
Fast forward to today and I'm nestled deep into the suburbs. A stones throw away from a baseball field, nestled between 3 golf courses, and my back towards a path that leads to a park where you will find four fenced tennis courts.

Today, my daughter dances and does gymnastics. My eldest son plays soccer and is a black belt in karate. My youngest thinks he's some sort of acrobat and daredevil. I don't think there is a sport televised where my children can't see someone on it that looks like them excel.

The sky is the limit. So it's on my wife and I to support our kids and allow them to try anything their little hearts desire. That's why I risked face planting at the ice rink last winter, why my wife bought a T Ball set this past summer, and why today I for the first time in 20 years picked up a tennis racquet.

Because not only do people who like them excel at anything they set their mind to, I too can try something new.
Also, it's January. Thanks Mother Nature!
