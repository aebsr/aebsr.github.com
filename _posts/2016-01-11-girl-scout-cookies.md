My daughter Mia is adding to her ever growing list of activities outside of school. She'll be starting guitar lessons soon. In addition to Ballet, Tap and Jazz dance she also takes Gymnastics. She has also joined the Girl Scouts. And yes, it's that time of year.

## COOKIE SALE!!!!

The girls are supposed to learn about business ethics, goal setting and money management. But I'm adding another item to the list of lessons to be learned - the strength of networking and social reach.

Cookies are $4 per box and and the available options are:

If you order 2 or more boxes and live in the Continental US I'll ship them to you no charge. If your in DC, Maryland or VA we can meet up at the nearest Bar or Metro Station.

We'll except Venmo and Cash.me.

Sincerely,
Mia & Me
