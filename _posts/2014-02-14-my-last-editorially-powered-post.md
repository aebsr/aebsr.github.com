[Yesterday](http://stet.editorially.com/articles/goodbye/), one of my favorite web applications announced it would be closing its doors. This sucks, but as we all know, that’s the startup life. An idea without execution is worthless. In some ways, so is a product without users. The latter was the case for [Editorially](http://editorially.com/).

## A Tale of Two Passions

I signed up for the beta right after hearing [Ethan](http://twitter.com/beep) mention the app during [An Event Apart](http://aneventapart.com/) last year. More interested in being a *beta user* than in writing, I planned to kick the tires, identify UX weaknesses and — of course — break the UI. Right before getting into the beta, Ethan convinced me to pursue speaking. After all, [we are all awesome](http://weareallaweso.me/). Then, less than a month later, I started getting back into making music. Suddenly, Editorially was primed for some heavy, real-world use as I began writing both talks and songs.

### This Is Why I Blog

After talking with Ethan, I brainstormed topics that I could write and speak about. When the first idea came, I logged into Editorially from the last row of the conference room and began rambling. During lunch, I logged in again on my phone to continue my dissection of disputed markup. Then, unable to sleep after happy hour at nclud, I wrote ambiguous analogies and metaphors to highlight my point. I wrote faster and more frequently in Editorially’s interface than I had ever written before. It was just so damn easy.

I started many blog-worthy posts — and even finished a few. You can see most of them here on this site. These are thoughts and opinions I likely would not have shared if it hadn’t been so easy to create them.

### A Rhyme-Book Reimagined

Recently reconnecting with some old musician friends renewed my desire to make new music — but I realized I also needed a new way to write. The days of maintaining an actual rhyme-book are long gone; I have a manilla folder tucked away, full of rhymes turning yellow with age. I have a handful of unfinished stanzas in Google Docs. Like most Google products, it was easy for me to use and hard for me to love.

Having evangelized Editorially while writing articles and blog posts, I figured I could use it to write and perfect lyrics. And so I did. I spent months writing, obsessing over cadence, and trying to find a balance between my appreciation for obscurity and a listeners need for clarity.

Then, this past Sunday, I stood in the studio, reciting lyrics as read from Editorially.

## A Lesson in Eggs and Baskets

Startup life is hard. There’s always someone trying to do what you do — faster, cheaper and (ideally) better. Because of this, I think us *early adopters* tend to cautiously invest our time in new tools. I live in a constant state fear that rdio one day will fall to spotify or Google play, and all of my collections and playlists will be lost. Or, that Simple will close shop and I’ll have to return to the evil world of big banking. But I continue to trust the little guy with no regrets.

I moved all documents, songs and ideas to Editorially only to find out that on May 30, the eve of my birthday, it will close its doors. Rather than mope my way back to Google Docs, I’m inspired to find the next best thing. Where are all the cool kids putting their docs? I don’t like native application-only options. I want my content in every way possible, all the time. So, please, I’m looking for new options.

## In Hindsight

> Editorially makes collaborative writing easy.

That’s the tagline; I agree, and so does a highly regarded editor I know. In her estimation, the key word above is “collaborative.” In previous roles, she would’ve found no use or value in Editorially, because she didn’t edit collaboratively; hers were the only edits that counted. Now, though, she works in an environment where iteration is constant — among sometimes a dozen “editors” — and version control is a forever problem. Now, she says, Editorially would be a godsend, sent to save her eyesight and her sanity from deciphering a rainbow of track changes.

Maybe that was the issue — that too much writing and editing still happens in silos, and there simply aren’t enough us, who not only get *it* but need *it*. That said, *it* will be missed. I wish all those involved the best. If/When I publish the aforementioned article or release my latest music project, I’ll be sure to give the folks at Editorially a shout out. Because it might not have happened without them.
