There was a weird juxtaposition today. A couple days after POTUS announced his Gun Control steps, I found myself driving to the gun shop to pick up a previously purchased firearm. CNN was on the radio interviewing the New Hampshire dealer who [gifted a custom AR](http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/05/politics/donald-trump-ar-15-gift-new-hampshire/) to Donald Trump. When asked if the dealers thought that President Obama wanted to take everyone's guns, the dealer said yes rather hesitantly.

What the dealer did admit though, was that the majority of the proposed steps weren't all that bad. That they would in fact not affect business much. Hell, business was great in fact because of all the panic buys every time Obama gets in front of a camera and says the word gun.

I pulled up to my shop, shaking off their negative energy. Convincing myself that because I lived in liberal Maryland and was entering a store staffed by young and open minded people the opinions here would of course be more constructive.

## Poketh The Bear

...and then I asked the clerk "Did you see Obama's statement?"

Immediately I was met with annoyance and shame. "I heard he cried," the clerk said, shaking his head in disappointment.

"Well, I'm pretty sure he just got choked up thinking about the dead kids and all," I snarkily replied.

Eventually we both acknowledged, we didn't fully know the context since neither of us actually watched the footage. We did, however, read over the talking points. We both agreed, although the clerk did so reluctantly, the steps suggested were mostly reasonable. The steps in fact, yet again, wouldn't really effect us as Maryland residents all that much.

## States Are The Problem

In my opinion, the flagship issue is the concept of states defining the rules. It's entirely ridiculous that how difficult or easy it is to get a gun is based on where you live. It's completely illogical to argue that it's a state issue when purchases can be made by out-of-state residents. The concept of Federal Firearm Licenses to sell or transfer guns speaks to that point. If your business can at any point act in the transferring of ownership of a firearm across state lines, it's no longer a state-only issue.

So what we need more than anything is a federal baseline. A minimum set of rules that all states must adhere to. Those rules should include background checks, training and education. I know this last one is going to be an issue, but they should also include psych evaluations. I know it can be subjective, but there has to be some sort of minimal requirement of mental stability and maturity established to own a firearm.

I'd also like there to be a federal ruleset about how firearms can be transported throughout the U.S. Hobbyists, instructors, collectors and even retired law enforcement personnel take their freedom in their own hands when crossing state lines. The laws for transporting firearms change on a per state and sometimes per city basis. A mistake, a wrong turn or a stop for gas in the wrong place can result in a felony.

## It's Bigger Than Self

What disgusted me most about the exchange with the clerk was how little he could empathize with the sadness and guilt of such a loss of life happening on your watch. This is what I'm convinced about many Gun Guys & Gals - they don't want to own and carry for the greater good. They want to own and carry to protect themselves. Their sense of self blurs their sense of community. Their sense of community rarely extends past people whose names they have committed to heart.

If their focus was on keeping the greater population safe, they'd have to feel something. The idea alone of participating in an industry that so grossly harms the general public should be enough to shock you into action. That doesn't need to mean turning over your guns. It doesn't have to mean losing your rights. It doesn't mean letting the bad guys win. It means having to sometimes put other people before you. It means treating a child harmed by gun violence with the same empathy and respect as you'd want for your own. It means expecting practitioners of your hobby to live up to a higher standard. It means accepting that your choice to exercise your Second Amendment right also means you have a responsibility to use it for good.

## What Can I Do?

I've spent a lot of time over the past year looking into programs and roles I could assist with and augment. It's varied from roles in the Citizen Academy, Animal Control, Volunteer Firefighter and Special Police. So far, nothing seems to be a good fit. Either because of time constraints or financial requirements. Yeah, those charged with maintaining public safety don't tend to get paid enough.

Here's an excerpt from [one of those posts](/2016/01/01/write-something/) I wrote last year but never finished.

> And so, I’m seriously considering joining the Citizen Academy. To better inform myself on the role of police, the laws they enforce and find opportunities to actually assist my community and it’s police in living/working side by side.

I guess my point is, if all you're doing to exercise your Second Amendment right is to stockpile guns and stay ready for when someone ever comes after YOU, then that's not enough. Let me repurpose your own slogan: "The only thing that can keep a gun out of a bad guy's hand is a good guy who cares about guns."

Regulate. Educate. Exercise.
