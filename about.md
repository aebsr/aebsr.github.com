### Outside of Work

My wife and kids keep me very busy. Between soccer, karate, gymnastics and diapers I try to fit in at least one date night every other week.

#### Idle Hands

On the rare ocassion I'm Not otherwise committed, I'll spend my time making music which is my first passion, exercising or at the range. Think gun powder, not golf balls. Oh, and wanting a motorcycle.
