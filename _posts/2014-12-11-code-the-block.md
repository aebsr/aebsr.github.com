For those that don't know, music is my first passion. As a result, I can't make it through a single day without headphones and good music. Though I have mildly diverse musical tastes, hip-hop is my bread and butter. Every line of code I've committed in the last year has been powered in some way by a steady stream of music. Despite 2014 being terrible for the quality of hip-hop releases, I managed to get my work done.

One night, I complained to my wife about how bad 2014 was musically. She asked, "Can you even come up with a top 10 for 2014?" The quick answer is: Not really. But, challenge accepted.

Consider it a gift to you. My top 13, '14. But for a taste of what you can expect checkout the below playlist.

## 1. [Mick Jenkins - The Waters <span class="rating">☆☆☆☆☆</span>](https://rd.io/i/QFNDPgomnQ/)
Shout out to [Bill Mill](https://twitter.com/llimllib) who put me on to this hip-hop gem. How cool is it that a guy I've ever met, but follow on both Twitter and rdio, listened to an album and thought "You know, you'd like this"? Well, you were right, Bill. I had missed this summer release, and am so glad you brought it to my attention. Earning the number one spot is Mick Jenkins as he spills his socially aware lyrics over an impressively consistent theme, "Water."

## 2. [Oddisee - Tangible Dream <span class="rating">☆☆☆☆☆</span>](https://rd.io/i/QFNDPngaMg/)
Oddisee makes three features in this list. Once for this solo effort, again for his group release and a label compilation. It's infinitely difficult to review a hip-hop release, giving equal appreciation for its musicality and lyrical content -- which makes Oddisee's work that much more impressive. As a mature and self-aware man, producer and MC Tangible Dream provides a consistently pleasant listen.

## 3. [Nitty Scott - The Art of Chill <span class="rating">☆☆☆☆</span>](https://rd.io/i/QFNDPgDHCA/)
Not much makes me happier than adding a long-awaited female voice to any top 10 list in hip-hop. Standing out in a genre that generally marginalizes women, Nitty Scott offers a soulful tone and contents that remind me of Lauren Hill's "Miseducation." She's true to her origins, though has trouble at times existing in her two worlds, and takes occasional breaks from empowering young women to celebrate the more basic aspects of her womanhood.

## 4. [Run The Jewels - Run The Jewels 2 <span class="rating">☆☆☆☆</span>](https://rd.io/i/QFNDPg9msA/)
Over the past few years, Run The Jewels' Killer Mike has earned a spot in my personal top three. In my opinion, there's been little since his R.A.P Music album that can truly be considered a classic. His cadence and production are just as solid here, though lacking a bit of its lyrical strength. He and EL-P complement each other in wonderfully sincere, funny, and offensive fashion.

## 5. [Ghetts - Rebel With A Cause <span class="rating">☆☆☆☆</span>](https://rd.io/i/QFNDPgNNsw/)
I had no idea who this guy was before stumbling upon his blood-red album cover with its imagery that seems to conflict with the album's title. However, the entire collection of songs are as dynamic and energetic as you'd expect from both. He may have received extra points for his accent, which lends itself to a more unique style and rhyme pattern.

## 6. [Blueprint - Respect The Architect <span class="rating">☆☆☆☆</span>](https://rd.io/i/QFNDPgOnQA/)
A rapper's rapper, Blueprint offers a smooth flow that plays nice with every beat it accompanies. It's a sleeper record that you can easily overlook. Your head nods as time passes without you noticing. Definitely worth multiple listens.

## 7. [Logic - Under Pressure <span class="rating">☆☆☆☆</span>](https://rd.io/i/QFNDPg82Yw/)
Logic, hailing from down the street -- literally. His rhyme pattern reminds me a bit too much of Kendrick Lamar, but subject-wise he brings nothing but unique perspective to the hip-hop landscape. A biracial, suburban, 90s kid loving hip-hop just outside of the Nation's Capital who models his personal brand after Frank Sinatra. You know you're in for something different when you listen to Logic.

## 8. [Apathy - Connecticut Casual <span class="rating">☆☆☆☆</span>](https://rd.io/i/QFNDPgAsvA/)
Keeping with this diverse list of MCs and records, I present you with a Connecticut-born, white rapper that splits his time between representing New England and rapping with one of the more aggressive rap coalitions out, Army Of The Pharaohs. Casual's sound is classic, but his overt pride in where he's from almost makes me want to visit.

## 9. [Big K.R.I.T - Cadillactica <span class="rating">☆☆☆☆</span>](https://rd.io/i/QFNDPg7eig/)
K.R.I.T is my only solo representative from the south, but I'm glad he made the cut. Cadillactica definitely has K.R.I.T leaning toward a more spoken word style, undoubtedly inspired by the success of his song "The Vent" -- which I find a way to quote on the regular. It's not as consistent or jam-filled as I've come to expect from him, but it is the epitome of mood music.

## 10. [¡Mayday! &amp; Murs - Mursday <span class="rating">☆☆☆☆</span>](https://rd.io/i/QFNDPgAyrw/)
Take Murs, a rapper as lyrically and stylisticly as diverse and entertaining as anyone else on this list. Put him ¡Mayday! a rap crew from Miami, who are changing what you should expect from MCs from the Sunshine State. Rarely do they focus on womanizing, sex or clubbing. The combination works well, and is more fun than it is anything else.

## 11. [GQ - Rated Oakland <span class="rating">☆☆☆☆</span>](https://rd.io/i/QFNDPgVddQ/)
Hailing from a part of California not yet gentrified by techies, I present to you GQ. I think he represents the left coast rather well, providing a classic sound with a forward-looking ambiance. He doesn't get stuck in what is stereotypically West Coast: drugs, gangs, and women. The album screams 'mixtape' more than it does 'album,' but is a pretty solid listen.

## 12. [Diamond District - March On Washington <span class="rating">☆☆☆☆</span>](https://rd.io/i/QFNDPgoV_A/)
This long-awaited follow up to "In The Ruff" is not as strong, but better than nothing. Production-wise Oddisee doesn't let you down. Along with Uptown XO and yU, they provide a sound as dear to my heart as Chuck Brown in his prime. If you want a glimpse into the sound of Washington, D.C. not heard about at your local meetup, give this a listen.

## 13. [Reks - Eyes Watching God <span class="rating">☆☆☆</span>](https://rd.io/i/QFNDPgY4pQ/)
Revolution-minded, Reks manages to slip in his message atop energetic and boom-bap instrumentals. It almost seems like he uses features to distract from his lyrical content -- like when Lauren Hill said, "I add a 'motherfucker' so you ignorant [people] hear me.'"
